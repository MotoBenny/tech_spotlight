# Tech Spotlight

Serves to give you a better understanding of what technologys, languages, frameworks and other tooling is most in demand, for a given area.

For now the tool checks Seattle, WA for job listings under "software engineer" posted in the past week.

In the future I plan to expand the tool to include more cities.

### Planned features

1. indeed.com scraping
2. duplicate handling (recognizing duplicates postings between the individual sites, as well as linkedin vs indeed)

### Stetch goals

Upload a parsed CSV to a database.
Create a complete informational front-end website that access the database and displays the resulting data in clear and easy to understand data visualizations.

Automate the scraper. to upload new data to the database on a set schedule, which will automatically be displayed on the website.
